# Web API test project

This is a sample Web app, written in spring-boot, that supports most of hte HTTP verbs. It can be used when we need to determine if the undelying infrastructure for some reason restricts certain HTTP verbs. Only the root endpoint, ```/``` is configured to respond, all others will respond with ```404```.
